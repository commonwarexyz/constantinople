These tarballs were packed from `exowarexyz/monorepo` commit
`f6fff69f2e315db5d0c33c51ead71e6e6fed611e`.

The Exoware TypeScript packages live in monorepo subdirectories, which npm
cannot install directly from a git commit. Keep these artifacts in sync with
the Cargo Exoware git revision in the workspace manifest.

When rebuilding the QMDB or Simplex wasm packages on macOS, use a clang with
WebAssembly target support, for example:
`CC_wasm32_unknown_unknown=/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/bin/clang npm run build`.
